Collection of scripts for zig. The PowerShell scripts are designed to be able to copy and paste a single command into a terminal and have it work.

I consider these to be a rough draft. I've tested them insomuch as they work on both PowerShell and Pwsh on my two windows machines but that's about it. There's a whole host of checks I can see that need to be done at some point but it should work for most people.
